Emit a random subset of lines from a file. This is a probabilistic
program, you will not get exactly `n` lines, but about `n` lines.

Typically, you can use shuf(1) which uses reservoir sampling and
is very efficient. However, if we want to extract 10M random lines
from a file of 100M lines, shuf(1) might be killed.";
